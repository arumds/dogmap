Associated files for alignment can be found at https://kiddlabshare.med.umich.edu/public-data/UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0-Y/

The genome reference is based on the German Shepherd assembly from [Wang et. al.] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01698-x)
supplemented with Y chromosome sequence from a Labrador retriever [GCF_014441545.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_014441545.1)

Specifically, the UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0 was downloaded from [UCSC](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam4/bigZips/).
UCSC naming conventions were utilized.  The following Y chromosome sequences were added:
